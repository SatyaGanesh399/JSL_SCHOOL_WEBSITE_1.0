        <p>Jagadeeswari School of Learning strongly believes - <b>“If a child can’t learn the way we teach, may be we should teach the way they learn.”</b> </p>
        <p>It is no longer okay to ignore or remove under-performing students from a school. Schools must have a resource room to cater to children with learning disabilities. It is an investment for the future of children, and a true commitment to education.</p>
        <p>The classroom is becoming increasingly a hotbed of myriad complexities and complexes, with children requiring support beyond academics. Many have emotional problems, behavioural issues that need sorting out, and a few have learning difficulties that cannot be overcome without learning support.</p>
        <p>The resource room is a classroom where a special education programme can be delivered to a student with a learning difficulty. It is for those students who belong to a regular class but need some special instructions in an individualised or small group setting for a portion of the day.</p>
        <p>Our Resource room has all the necessary documentation in place. This includes a separate file for each child containing an assessment report, an Individual Educational Programme (IEP) for every three to four months, lesson plans for every week, and worksheets completed by the child. It is tedious but a treasure trove as one can thumb through the file and actually see the extent of progress in terms of higher goals and increased accuracy of spelling and written work.</p>
        <p>Under my supervision, other professionals like <b>Behavioural Therapist, Occupational Therapist, Speech Therapist and Special Educator</b> will work, by maintaining a smooth relationship between all with a motto of non-interference coupled with respect and co-ordination.</p>
