        <h1 class="mb-5 text-primary">Teach Kids About Dignity Of Labour üè´ üìöüëç</h1>

        <p>A month ago I posted one question for poll survey - ' the importance of teaching kid about dignity of labour' . only four parents accepted for that.</p>
        <p>Ofcourse, we all want our children to grow into successful, confident and happy individuals -- we want them to have the best of everything. But we need to remember that teaching them good values and fostering gratitude in them for what they have, is also a big part of parenting.</p>
        <p>I could recollect my childhood days, there were a few people who were an integral part of our household, the cook, a wise old lady and the gardener. These were people who were obviously not part of the family, but were almost so. Even in our worst of moods, we couldn‚Äôt dream of being rude to them; for the codes of conduct were closely monitored by the adults.</p>
        <p>As time moved on, we got busier and wealthier. Our families became smaller and smaller, with expenses towards luxury going higher every moment. Larger homes, in posher colonies, with larger cars in the porch, better schools, international travel, gourmet meals and what not. At the same time, however, it is important to teach them to value their privileged lifestyle, as well as respect those who lead more modest ones -- they should be taught not to look down upon people who have less than they do, nor demean them in any way. We should educate our children about the dignity of labour.</p>
        <p>Our dependencies on what we call ‚Äòdomestic help‚Äô have increased, and we have surrounded ourselves with people from lesser privileged backgrounds to help make our lives easier. But let us, for a moment look at it through the eyes of impressionable young minds; minds of our young children.</p>
        <p>Recently I was confronted by a scene one day, where my fourteen-year old Niece hands on hips, was looking at the painting she had put out to dry, and say in an accusatory tone, ‚ÄúBhagya Aunty, why did you touch my painting? Do you even know how difficult it is to paint this thing?‚Äù The culprit, however, was a ten-year old,Nephew lurking in the background.</p>
        <p>The kids have seen me give away clothes and toys that they have outgrown, to the domestic help at home. One day, I got the jolt of my life when a too-smart-for-his-own-good ten-year old tells me, ‚ÄúThis toy is broken ‚Äì give it to Bhagya Aunty!‚Äù ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>
        <p>A defiant fourteen-year old had once exclaimed, ‚ÄúCheeeee!! Why should I mop the floor? That‚Äôs what Bhagya Aunty is for!‚Äù when I asked her to clean up the mess she had created.</p>
        <p>This most certainly was not the message we wanted to teach them!</p>
        <p>Many other incidents, over the last few years of the kids growing up, have reflected to us how our behavior has influenced their attitude towards dignity of labour. </p>
        <p>I have started a few measures to counter the attitudes they seem to have developed. Same sharing with you.</p>
        <p>When it comes to daily routines as a responsible parent, you need to teach them that maidservants are not to be ordered around -- they are to be spoken to politely and respected. you can tell them carry their own plates into the kitchen after a meal, have them put washed and ironed clothes back into their closets, and get them to put their toys away after playtime sessions. In the process, they will earn respect for those expected to perform these tasks for them, responsibility and independence. At the same time, when your house staff is on leave, it will become easier for the children to manage things and you will have a helping hand.</p>
        <p>Children should be made aware of all those who make life easier for them , and if everyone refused menial jobs, we'd have to start doing them ourselves.</p>
        <p>Impress upon our kids that an honest living is a respectable living, whether it is made in a plush office or by the roadside. They need to be appreciative of hard work and of those who play a role in society. Somebody once told me that a child refused to speak in Hindi because it was the 'servants' language'! Obviously, the youngster must have heard an adult say something to that effect. Children tend to discuss their parents' occupations and are sometimes ashamed of them because of what friends may say.</p>
        <p>It's a wonderful thing to teach children charity -- But make sure that they don't consider those at the receiving end to be below them. Take them for a visit to an orphanage and take some gifts for the underprivileged. Teach kids to donate a small amount each month from their pocket money, and from their salaries when they grow up. Allow them to decide how much money to set aside and which needy person or institution they would like to help and in what manner. This will help them develop compassion, but it can also be a lesson in equality -- one who has less than you deserves your kindness and goodwill, but is not less important than you.</p>
        <p>My Dears!! Whatever you want your children to learn and whatever you say, always remember that YOUR ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN YOUR WORDS.. They are watching you and learning from you all the time. So the best way to teach them anything is to model them yourself. You are your children's best teacher and teaching them respect for others may be the best gift you ever give them...</p>
