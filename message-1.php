        <p>Dear all parents, who are having school aged children üòä</p>
        <p>I am expressing thru this letter are whatever I just got in my mind. You might be inclined to create a minute by minute schedule for kids. You may have high hopes of hours of learning, including online activities, science experiments, and book reports. But our kids are just as scared as we are right now. Our kids not only can hear everything that is going on around them, but they feel our constant tension and anxiety. They have never experienced anything like this before. Although the idea of being off of school for weeks sounds awesome, they are probably picturing a fun time like summer break, not the reality of being trapped at home and not seeing their friends.</p>
        <p>Over the coming weeks, we will see an increase in behavior issues with our kids. Whether it is anxiety, or anger, or protest that they can‚Äôt do things normally ‚Äì it will happen. We will see more meltdowns, tantrums and oppositional behavior in the coming weeks. This is normal and expected under these circumstances.</p>
        <p>Our kids need right now is to feel comforted and loved. To feel like it‚Äôs all going to be ok. And that might mean that we should tear up our perfect schedule and love on our kids a bit more. I am strongly encouraging playing games, baking, painting, snuggling under a blanket to watch movies or completing science experiments together. Start a book and read together as a family.</p>
        <p>Don‚Äôt worry about them regressing in school. Every single kid is in this boat and they all will be ok. When we are back in the classroom, we will all course correct and meet them where they are. Teachers are experts at this! Don‚Äôt pick fights with kids because they don‚Äôt want to do math. Don‚Äôt scream at kids for not following the schedule. Don‚Äôt mandate two hours of learning time if they are resisting it. We should avoid yelling at children if they resist completing school tasks at home after long periods of time.</p>
        <p>At the end of all of this, want to conclude with most signifiacant advice of prioritising the child‚Äôs mental health over their academic skills. And how they felt during this time will stay with them long after the memory of what they did during those weeks is long gone. So keep that in mind, ‚Äòevery single day‚Äô.</p>
        <p>WE DON‚ÄôT NEED TO KNOW THE WHOLE ALPHABET OF SAFETY. THE a,b,c OF IT WILL SAVE US, IF WE FOLLOW IT: ALWAYS BE CAREFUL.üëç‚úå üíê</p>
