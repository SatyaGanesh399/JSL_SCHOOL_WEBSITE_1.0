                <p>Inclusive Education (IE) is a new approach towards educating the children with disability and learning difficulties with that of normal ones within the same roof. It brings all students together in one classroom and community, regardless of their strengths or weaknesses in any area, and seeks to maximize the potential of all students. It is one of the most effective ways in which to promote an inclusive and tolerant society. </p>

                <p>At KOTHAPET EDIFY Inclusive Education is about looking at the ways the lessons are designed so that all children can participate and learn. Inclusion is also about finding different ways of teaching so that classrooms actively involve all children. It also means finding ways to develop friendships, relationships and mutual respect between all children, and between children and teachers in the school. </p>

                <p>With us, Inclusive Education is not just for some children. Being included is not something that a child must be ready for. All children are at all times ready to attend regular schools and classrooms. Their participation is not something that must be earned. </p>
                <p>Here we see that it's a way of thinking about how to be creative, where all children can participate. Creativity may mean teachers learning to teach in different ways or designing their lessons so that all children can be involved. </p>
