            <h4 class="text-success mb-4">Safety Measures</h4>
            <p>We provide a safe environment for kids by taking the same safety precautions you do at home. There would be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No choking hazards, including small toys or play things that can break apart into small pieces</li>
                <li>No pillows or fluffy bedding in cribs; babies should be put to sleep on their backs</li>
                <li>Gates on open stairways</li>
                <li>Window guards on upstairs windows</li>
                <li>Spic-and-span bathroom</li>
                <li>An enclosed, secure outdoor space for play</li>
                <li>Clear floors (i.e., not littered with toys)</li>
                <li>Smoke detectors, clearly marked exits and fire extinguishers</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="text-success mb-4">A stimulating environment</h4>
            <p>You can find lots of verbal and physical interaction between kids and caregivers. Staff get down on the floor and interact with kids. And engage kids.</p>
            <p>We provide age-appropriate toys that are in good shape. We send email updates to parents, of the daily activities, which include lots of singing, talking, reading and dancing as well as on-the-floor playtime activities. </p>
            <h4 class="text-success mb-4">Separation of age groups </h4>
            <p>Babies under 18 months wouldn't be mingling with toddlers and older children — bigger tots can be pretty exuberant and haven't yet mastered being gentle with infants. </p>
            <h4 class="text-success mb-4">Happy children and staff</h4>
            <p>You can see, clean babies in spacious rooms, with a quiet area where they can nap in separate beds (and according to their own schedules). Our Caregivers are energetic, patient and genuinely interested in the kids. When you visit towards the end of the day, you will get more accurate picture of what the centre is like than you would first thing in the morning.</p>
            <h4 class="text-success mb-4">As always, we are putting safety first to protect our families and staff.</h4>
            <p>You can see our Health & Safety measures in action! You will notice at our centre:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Handwashing and sanitizing. Everyone who enters the building will need to wash hands, and we’ll continue to integrate handwashing into the curriculum. Hand sanitizer will be available throughout the centre.  </li>
                <li>Stay home if sick. If you or your child has been sick, we ask that the ill person stay home until they have been symptom-free without medication for at least 72 hours. Classrooms will be open to healthy individuals only. </li>
                <li>Sick space. centres will have a dedicated space (in or out of the classroom) where teachers can care for sick children while being separated from others until a family member can come to pick up. </li>
                <li>Same person drop-off and pick-up. Families are asked to assign one or two family member(s) for drop off and pick up to minimize exposure to multiple people. If this is not possible, we ask parents to get pick-up card to those members other than parent to drop/pick children at the centre.</li>
                <li>Restricted classroom access. To minimize potential exposure, we ask that families not walk your child to their classroom when you arrive. Instead, please check in with staff in the lobby, and staff will walk your child to their classroom. Classrooms will be reserved for teachers and children only. </li>
                <li>Physical distancing. We’ll continue to practice social distancing as much as possible to reduce risk. To minimize potential exposure, children will continue to keep distance from children and staff in other classrooms. </li>
                <li>Classroom cleanliness. Toys, playground equipment, and other high-touch surfaces will be regularly disinfected and rotated throughout the day. We will pause the use of sensory tables, play dough, large pillows or stuffed animals, and other materials that are difficult to clean. </li>
                <li>Modifications to family-style dining. We have modified our shared mealtime practices to reduce the spread of germs. Students will still eat together but will not be serving themselves. </li>
                <li>Playground restrictions. Outdoor play structures will be utilized by one class at a time, with increased time between play to allow for cleaning. </li>
                <li>Field trips and events. Trips and events could be cancelled or postponed until further notice. </li>
                <li>Health screening and temperature checks. Instead of families taking children’s temperatures at home, our staff may check temperatures on-site at check-in. </li>
                <li>Stay home if sick. Instead of 48 hours, we may require sick individuals to be symptom-free 72 hours before returning to the centre.</li>
            </ul>
